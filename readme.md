## autoshutdown mod

Allows admins to schedule a shutdown when the last player leaves.

The server shuts down a little time after the last player leaves,
to make sure all areas are slowly unloaded.

To schedule an automatic shutdown, issue the `/autoshutdown` command
in chat. The shutdown will only happen once.
